1. Null Hypothesis

   Your idea/question is interesting and testable. By comparing two groups, we can understand the weekend bike usage pattern for riders and the null hypothesis is correctly formulated and you also expressed in a right formula. 
   
2. Data

   You did a good job cleaning the data and choosing the data that you need for further analysis. You grouped the date of trips into weekdays categories, I think this is appropriate features (variables) to answer the question and test the null hypothesis. 
   
3. Tests
There are few tests that might be useful to test the hypothesis: 

Z-test

A Z-test is any statistical test for which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution. Because of the central limit theorem, many test statistics are approximately normally distributed for large samples. For each significance level, the Z-test has a single critical value (for example, 1.96 for 5% two-tailed) which makes it more convenient than the Student's t-test which has separate critical values for each sample size. Therefore, many statistical tests can be conveniently performed as approximate Z-tests if the sample size is large or the population variance is known. If the population variance is unknown (and therefore has to be estimated from the sample itself) and the sample size is not large (n < 30), the Student's t-test may be more appropriate.

chi-squared test

A chi-squared test, also written as a Ï‡2 test, is any statistical hypothesis test where the sampling distribution of the test statistic is a chi-squared distribution when the null hypothesis is true. Without other qualification, 'chi-squared test' often is used as short for Pearson's chi-squared test. The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories.

T-test 

The t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. A t-test is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known. When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by an estimate based on the data, the test statistics (under certain conditions) follow a Student's t distribution. The t-test can be used, for example, to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.
